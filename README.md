# Todo List Application

## Description
This is a Todo List application developed as part of The Odin Project's JavaScript course. It allows users to manage their tasks effectively with various features.

## Features

### Todo Items
Each todo item has a title, description, due date, and category. 

### Categorized and Uncategorized Todos
Users can view categorized and uncategorized todos separately by clicking on the `Categorized` and `Uncategorized` buttons respectively.

### Notes
Users can view all todos by clicking on the `Notes` button.

### Search Functionality
The application includes a search functionality that renders the todo UI based on the text available in the title, description, and category of the todos.

### Local Storage
The application uses the localStorage web API to store todos. This allows the userâ€™s todos to persist across multiple browser sessions, even if the browser is fully closed and reopened. 

## Future Enhancements

### Priority Feature
A future enhancement for this application is the implementation of a priority feature for the todo items. This will allow users to set the priority of each task, helping them to focus on the most important tasks first.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser and enjoy.
